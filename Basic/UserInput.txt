The UserInput.cpp code upon compilation gives no error.
It will also not goinng to give the expected output.
It will give something like: 
```
May I know your name: Shankar
Mahy I know your full name: Welcome: Shankar
Welcome:
```

Explanation of the issue:
-------------------------
The issue in code arises from the way cin and getline handle input.
When we use cin >> name, it reads input until the first whitespace (space, newline, etc.) and leaves the newline character ('\n') in the input buffer. 
When getline is called next, it reads this leftover newline character as an empty string.

To fix this, we should ignore the leftover newline character after reading the first input. 

Here is the revised corrected code: CorrectUserInput.cpp
